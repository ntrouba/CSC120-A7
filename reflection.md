Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For this homework I collaborated with Lily Garner and Liberty Lehr.

In the Library class I decided to overload addBook() and removeBook() which makes it possible to add or remove two books at the same time.

In the House class I decided to overload moveIn() two times so that people can be added in groups of 2 or 3 for people sharing a room.

In the Cafe class I overloaded sellCoffe() to have a method for selling black coffee. I also overload restock() for restocking only coffee.

Overloading simplifies making changes a lot so I liked that. The most tedious part was adding in the information about the buildings.
